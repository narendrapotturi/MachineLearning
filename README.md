# MachineLearning

#Diabetes Problem:

Using KNN Algorithm, I have solved the Diabates problem using the inputs like Glucose, Insulin, BMI etc. I have Done the preprocessing steps in order to remove the null values and imputed with feature engineering techniques. And i have done trained the model several times in order to find the correct K values using Elbow technique. Based on that tested the test data and evaluated the model using metrics ( F1_score, ROC_AUC_Curve, ROC_AUC_Score). 

#Big Mart Sales Prediction:

Since it is Linear probelm, we need to indentify the sales of each product based on the previous data. I have used Linear Regression and NLP(Deep Learning) in order to find the sales. In Deep Learning, I have used Keras and tensorflow and created the models and compiled and evaluated the model using accuracy metrics.

#Black Friday Sales:

It is Also similar kind of Linear problem, So i have done EDA on the data and created Linear Regression as well as NLP in order to find out the sales on Black friday.

#NYC Taxi Trip (EDA):

Here i have done EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the Taxi trip duration. Like where the usage of taxi is more and at what time and on whic day of week with Vizulaization.
